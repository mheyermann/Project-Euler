# Data Analysis with Python #
In this folder you can find the exercises to aprove the certification of "Data Analysis with Python", from __[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/)__ <br>
I made some adjustments to fit it on my Portfolio, you can find the actual exercises on the [certificate](#Certificate).
For each problem there is a `main` Jupyter Notebook, with the description of the exercise and the answer. Each exercise has a python file with the code created to solve the problem.
